# FinalProject 
- The problem that I solved in this project is the use of manual records by pet adoption centers usually due to limited resources and funds (which cause lack in access to advanced software systems). 
- My solution to this problem consists of a system that:
-  tracks pets available for adoption through an ArrayList
-  tracks adopted pets using an array and removes them from the active adoption list
-  maintains the data's consistency by saving the state of the available and adopted pets to separate files once user chooses to exit
-   improves precision and reduces error by use of recursive input validation and try-catch blocks (prevents common user mistakes such as invalid inputs and also protects shelter's data from crashes/incorrect input handling.


HOW TO RUN PROGRAM:
1. Compile program on Codespaces by entering "javac PetAdoptionSystem.java" in the terminal
2. After compiling, enter "java PetAdoptionSystem" in the terminal
